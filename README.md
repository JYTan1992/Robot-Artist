# Robot-Artist
Programmed a robot arm to draw pencil sketches of a given picture.

Extracted edges from the robotâ€™s field of vision with Canny algorithm and generated the trajectory of the robotic arm with self-designed algorithm accordingly. Controlled the movement of the robotic arm as planned through inverse kinematics using pre-determined D-H parameters.

Crafted a buffering device to avoid paper being poked through by the pencil due to lack of pressure sensors
